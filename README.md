# Visualizing Global CO₂ Emissions

This project explores CO₂ emissions data from **1750 to 2021** across various countries.  
It includes data cleaning, insightful visualizations, and an **interactive dashboard** to analyze global CO₂ trends and their relation to population and temperature.

## Dataset

- Source: [Our World in Data – CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
- Contains historical CO₂ emission data by country from 1750 to 2021.
- Includes related fields like population, GDP, and temperature indicators.

## Project Goals

- Identify the **top 10 countries** contributing to CO₂ emissions.
- Analyze the **cumulative CO₂ contribution** of these countries over time.
- Compare **CO₂ emissions**, **population size**, and **temperature data** across countries.
- Build an **interactive dashboard** for user-friendly exploration of global CO₂ trends.

## Tasks Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations using bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps
- Created an interactive dashboard using **Plotly** and **Dash / Streamlit**

## Sample Questions Answered

- What are the top 10 countries in terms of CO₂ emissions?
- What is the cumulative percentage of CO₂ emissions by top countries?
- How do CO₂ levels correlate with population and temperature?
